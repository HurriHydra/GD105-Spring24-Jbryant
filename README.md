Unit 4, Assignment 1:

This assignment is about copying typerwriter art through coding. My main goal for this assignment was to make bottles that represent hugs and kisses (X and Os).
This art peace is called Unusual Love Poem by Andrew Belsey (1987), and I found it to be something simple to do and I like how it turned out.

Unit 4, Assignment 2:
The Visualization Piece grabs data from the amount of people who liked or disliked waffles. My main goal was to make an RPG stat system where it displays the data of
people who liked or don't eat/dislike waffles. The way I gathered this information was through discord and I asked 8 people with 4 different role colors about
waffles. 

The waffle level = they like waffles.
difficulty level = they don't like them/never had waffles.

Unit 5, Assignment 1:
My game piece is fairly simple as it revovles around collecting coins by moving the circle with "W,A,S, and D.' You have one minute to collect as many coins as you
can until the timer runs out. Originally I was going to add more such as walls and a color switch function that lets you go through certain colored walls but I had
no time to do so. This includes sound as well since I'm doing this at the last minute.

Controls
W,A,S,D = Moving
J = Change color
